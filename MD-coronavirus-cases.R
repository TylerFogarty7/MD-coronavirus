# Produce a simple graph of Coronavirus cases in Maryland State (USA) since the 1st cases detected
# Source of data: https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/ (updated daily at ~ 10am)
# Rationale for doing this: no history of past cases and removal of some data (see below)
# Explanations: https://jepoirrier.org (maybe search for "coronavirus")
